# Employee Tracker

## Description

Video Walkthrough can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BCXoRolB7xxIAvhk7cXv8DRT5KepQ7In/view).

This is an application designed to practice skills with SQL, Node.js, and the inquirer package (with preparation for doing the same work with APIs and Express). It shows the basic functionality of working with an SQL datbase to manage employee records. Future applications would of course require a front end, but this provided a great way to gain comfort with these systems.


## Installation

Please install Node.js and the NPM packages inquirer 8.2.4 and mysql2 to use. You'll need to have an IDE as well to use Inquirer.

## Usage

Once installed, run node index.js, and the application will begin in the Command Line.
